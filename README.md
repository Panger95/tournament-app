# tournament-app
Technical challenge set for the last week of the Develop Me course. The MVP should create pairings for a table tennis tournament from a list of user-inputted names.


This project randomizes a user-inputted list of names and creates match pairings. 

I have added multi-round funtionality however i am yet to complete this functioinailty.

I have also focused mainly on functionality and as yet the styling is very bootstrappy and boring. However this will change!

I have also created an API through Laravel which i hope to itegrate with the redux store, using Axios. 

As my first solo project i have really enjoyed thius challenge and cant wait to continue building on functionality like recording players scores and Css animations!
